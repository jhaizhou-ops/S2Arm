/* capprobe.h — GS + occlusion-query runtime capability probe (#1456).
 *
 * The probe arms run one-per-spawned-helper-process (a GS draw inside an
 * open occlusion query can return VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST; the failure must
 * not happen inside the game process's Vulkan device). The helper is the
 * standalone capprobe executable built from capprobe.c with
 * S2A_CAPPROBE_STANDALONE: packaged into the APK as
 * lib/<abi>/libs2a_capprobe.so (jniLibs source directory — AGP packages
 * only shared libraries, so the executable borrows the lib*.so name),
 * stored uncompressed and page-aligned inside the APK and run through the
 * system linker: posix_spawn("/system/bin/linker64", {linker64,
 * "<sourceDir>!/lib/arm64-v8a/libs2a_capprobe.so", ...}) — the exec target
 * is a system file, and bionic maps an apk!/ library like any other .so
 * (Android 10+; #1482: files/ exec is banned on targetSdk ≥29, and the
 * nativeLibraryDir route required package-wide extractNativeLibs) —
 * never fork()+in-process code, which deadlocks on locks inherited held
 * from the ART process's other threads. The Java CapProbe class owns the
 * decision contract and the files/capprobe/<hash>.json cache; this header
 * is the native side's small interface to both.
 *
 * Threading: s2a_capprobe_run blocks its caller for up to the timeout;
 * it is invoked from the game-start worker before any device exists. */
