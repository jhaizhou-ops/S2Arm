# S2Arm Mac launcher

Native SwiftUI/AppKit launcher migrated from [LumaDock](https://github.com/Xc1Ym/LumaDock)
`238c1dd` under MIT. The library, details, sidebar, settings and task-page surfaces
are synchronized with [LumaNX](https://github.com/Xc1Ym/LumaNX) main
`88723426bca0049ef16156683e40f8fee486bb20` (0.2.19). Original copyright and permission
notices are retained below. S2Arm keeps its own engine, storage, job operations,
community resources, graphics modes, save management and cross-platform build flow.
The library, details, onboarding, settings, appearance, translations, task progress,
diagnostics and input editor retain that interaction model. The engine adapter uses
S2Arm's own LibHac reader, rewriter, system-data/index stages, shader pipeline and
NativeAOT host.

This is the Mac launcher. Its optional cross-platform build page delegates to
existing S2Arm features with app-managed components. Other platform shells keep their existing interfaces.
The shared local job entry point is `pack/jobs/main.py`, so later frontends can
reuse the task/storage layer without depending on SwiftUI.

## Compact UI sync / 紧凑界面同步

2026-11-02 对齐 LumaNX `8872342`：游戏库统计与搜索使用同高的 42 点胶囊；
详情封面 64 点、内边距 16 点，详情默认展开且置于管理操作之前；包信息按紧凑
两行展示。任务页使用 820 点内容宽度，任务卡与诊断折叠采用同一套紧凑玻璃样式。
保留 S2Arm 的兼容性提示、存档管理、跨平台构建和任务阶段接线。
S2Arm 目录数据中的 `display` 是导入版本，字段标为“导入版本”，不将它宣称为当前运行版本。
macOS 15–25 继续使用已有材质和系统按钮兼容路径。构建显式区分最低运行版本
与当前 Xcode SDK，并核对最终 Mach-O 元数据，避免新系统误用旧式按钮。

工具页与弹窗进一步共用 `WorkspaceLayout`：820 点工具页宽度、16 点外边距、
12 点卡片内边距、32 点空副标题标题栏。设置使用紧凑控制行与说明折叠；平台选择
使用同高横排；已结束的失败任务使用摘要行和详情弹出层；实时日志按需展开。
装机说明、存档、输入设置与首次运行也使用相同间距，长操作引导内容滚动显示，
底部操作保持可见。手柄图中按键几何与命中区域保持原样。

## Optional cross-platform builds / 可选跨平台编译

在 Mac 侧栏打开「跨平台编译」，按需启用 iOS、安卓或鸿蒙。游戏详情中的
「跨平台编译…」会携带当前游戏进入 iOS 页；iPhone 出包与目标设备选择
统一收在该页，游戏详情不再单独显示。GUI 直接复用
S2Arm 已有功能，不要求玩家定位源码、编译目录、产物目录或预生成工程。
平台源码、构建缓存与产物由应用管理，默认不会下载额外平台支持。

| 页面 | 玩家操作 | 复用的源码功能 | 当前输出 |
|---|---|---|---|
| iOS | 选择游戏库中的游戏和目标设备，点击「开始编译」 | 主线 `Store.packIPhone` → `pack/jobs/ipa.py` → `pack/oneclick/oneclick.sh` | IPA 与资源包 |
| 安卓 | 按需添加平台支持、准备 Docker 工具链 | `android/docker/build.sh` | Android 壳的调试 APK；当前不暴露预生成工程接口 |
| 鸿蒙 | 按需添加平台支持；自动检测已安装的工具链 | `runtime/ohos/build.sh` | 原生目标文件 `.o`；源码尚无 HAP 编译入口 |

游戏下拉框显示游戏名称；三个平台的主按钮均为「开始编译」，使用锤子图标，
位于配置卡片顶部。
「编译环境」默认折叠，展开后可检查环境、查看结果并准备缺少的组件。
满足条件后点击顶部的编译按钮。编译结束可通过任务中的
「在访达中查看产物」打开结果，不需要设置内部路径。平台构建、下载、准备
工具链与游戏运行共用串行执行槽，沿用任务取消、进度和失败诊断。

引擎和组件定位由 Mac 前端内部完成：优先复用现有引擎；编译应用通过既有
`pack/jobs/embedded.py` 安装已验证、可写的引擎缓存；缺少的可选平台在玩家
点击「添加平台支持」时获取到应用私有目录。旧版本保存的源码、输出目录和
SDK 路径配置不再使用。iOS 沿用主线的 `<游戏库>/iPhone/<游戏号>/`，OHOS 输出放在应用私有 `exports/`，Android 沿用
原有脚本输出位置。NDK 从已安装的 DevEco Studio、应用管理的工具链，或已有
`OHOS_NDK` / `OHOS_SDK_HOME` / `DEVECO_SDK_HOME` 环境中自动发现。

iOS 直接复用主线的游戏库、目标设备检测、应用自带字体、磁盘预检、里程碑进度与
.NET 10 SDK 一键安装；不再维护独立的文件夹出包入口。仍需要完整 Xcode。安卓工具链由源码的
Dockerfile 准备，需要先安装并启动 Docker；不连接设备。当前源码没有提供的
游戏加载、渲染与 HAP 编译能力，不在 GUI 中重复实现。

The optional build page invokes S2Arm's existing features directly. Players do
not choose source checkouts, build/output directories, SDK directories or prepared
projects. The app resolves its engine, manages optional platform components and
output locations, and reuses global player data settings. Compilation stays in
the existing source scripts. iOS calls the mainline iPhone job, including target-device
selection, bundled fonts, disk checks, milestone progress and SDK installation;
the Mac-only `gui_jobs` bridge handles Android/OHOS arguments and
job presentation using the shared job/engine installation functions unchanged.

## Review dependencies

This frontend is deferred for the repository's user-experience review phase.
The shared changes from PR #45 are split into independent PRs:

| Area | PR | Contract |
|---|---|---|
| First-run root guard | [#46](https://github.com/jhaizhou-ops/S2Arm/pull/46) | Shell path resolution, absent roots and symlink aliases |
| Process-group cancellation | [#47](https://github.com/jhaizhou-ops/S2Arm/pull/47) | Full command matching, existing safety checks retained |
| Container metadata / DLC | [#48](https://github.com/jhaizhou-ops/S2Arm/pull/48) | `--inspect`, `--title-id`, opt-in `--aoc-index` and `S2A_SEED_AOC=1` |
| Explicit frontend toolchain | [#49](https://github.com/jhaizhou-ops/S2Arm/pull/49) | Child-process Python/Xcode/NuGet paths, actual Xcode path logged |
| Prebuilt preparation tools | [#50](https://github.com/jhaizhou-ops/S2Arm/pull/50) | Actual binary/assembly hashes and target SDK/Metal versions in cache keys |

These shared PRs must land before building this frontend from `main`. Integration
checks combine their commits locally; the frontend PR no longer carries their
public-file changes. Gate registration covers only `launchers/macos/` and
`pack/jobs/`, preserving existing shared-file coverage.

The scope follows `docs/贡献指南.md`, `docs/架构_多终端.md` and
`docs/standards/repository.md`: the Mac shell uses existing engine interfaces;
this change does not migrate the core directories or alter runtime/C# ABI. Launcher
NDJSON remains its local task protocol and does not implement or replace the
planned runtime log protocol in `docs/standards/logging.md`. Runtime markers and
measurement logs retain their existing contract. Full gate/train/merge remain
with the owning maintainer lines.

## Build and run

Apple Silicon and macOS 15+ are needed for the S2Arm app and direct-mode play on the Mac (games execute natively as arm64).
Intel Macs are supported for building iPhone packages only, through the command-line `pack/oneclick/oneclick.sh`
(check the environment first with `python3 pack/jobs/applenv.py`). The application bundles Python 3.12,
pinned `capstone`, `lz4`, `numpy`, .NET 10 runtime, `zstd`, SPIRV-Tools,
the in-tree perl `timeout` (`tools/bin/timeout`) and the precompiled S2Arm preparation helpers. Players install no Python
packages, .NET SDK or Homebrew. Preparing games uses an external full Xcode with
Metal compiler components; launching a prepared game does not require Xcode.
Apple SDKs and compilers are **not** bundled. Game/keys/shared-font data are
player-provided. Checks never install or download dependencies.

### Building from source

One command checks every build dependency and prepares the ones that live in the
source tree. It reports each missing item together with the command that installs it:

```sh
python3 launchers/macos/prepare_build.py            # add --check to only inspect, --venv <dir> to choose the venv
```

| Dependency | Rule | Prepared by the command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Apple Silicon Mac | The runtime keeps arm64 slices only | Checked |
| Full Xcode with iOS platform and Metal Toolchain | Resolved like packaging (`tools/toolchain.sh`): `S2A_DEVELOPER_DIR` or `tools/machine.local`, then `xcode-select`. A Metal compiler version different from `translator/dmsh_chain.lock` prints a `note` only (`dmsh_chain.py --build-env` lets it through; the shader cache is keyed by compiler, so a different Xcode just recompiles) | Checked |
| .NET SDK | Whatever `compat/tree/global.json` accepts: `version` plus `rollForward: latestFeature` (currently 10.0.403 or a later 10.0 feature band / patch). The command runs `dotnet --version` inside `compat/tree`, so .NET itself applies the rule. Install with `python3 pack/jobs/applenv.py --install dotnet` (the same path the launcher uses) | Checked |
| Homebrew `python@3.12 spirv-tools spirv-cross glslang zstd bash cmake meson ninja` | Runtime collection (`bundle_runtime.py`), C rewriter (CMake 3.18+), dav1d (meson / ninja) | Checked; prints the `brew install` line |
| Rust (`cargo`) | `pack/devpush` | Checked |
| Build Python venv (default `build/venv`) | Pinned `tools/rewriter-requirements.txt`, `pack/fonts/requirements.txt` (fonttools / skia-pathops for the bundled fonts) and `launchers/macos/requirements-runtime.txt` | Created and installed |
| C rewriter sources | Pinned Capstone / LZ4 from `runtime/rewriter/prepare_deps.py`; looked up in `S2A_REWRITER_DEPS`, then `build/rewriter-deps`, then `<S2A_RUN_ROOT>/s2arm/deps/rewriter-deps` | Downloaded to `build/rewriter-deps` when none is complete |

Then build with the interpreter the command printed:

```sh
build/venv/bin/python3 launchers/macos/build_app.py     # --developer-dir <Xcode.app/Contents/Developer> overrides the Xcode choice
open build/macos/S2Arm.app
```

`build_app.py` rebuilds `build/macos/Runtime` through `bundle_runtime.py` whenever it is missing or stale.
For command-line packaging and tests, point `S2A_PY` at the same interpreter (environment variable or a
`S2A_PY=` line in `tools/machine.local`, see `tools/machine.local.example`). Nothing in the build or packaging
scripts falls back to a maintainer's private paths; an unset dependency is reported, not guessed.
Work caches go under `S2A_RUN_ROOT` (default `~/.s2arm/run`; the app always sets a private one).

`timeout` is copied from `tools/bin/timeout` (perl) in this repository. bash 5 stays a separately invoked GPL-3.0 program;
its license text and source offer are copied into the app. The runtime builder installs pinned
Python requirements, relocates libraries, keeps Apple Silicon binary slices,
signs native code and audits runtime links. The host and C# preparation tools are
compiled during application packaging, never on the player's machine. This is a
local ad-hoc build; this PR does not publish a notarized binary release.

### Using the built app

The packaged app includes the S2Arm NativeAOT/Metal Mac host, NSP/XCI reader and
preparation tools. No external engine checkout is needed. Native runtime libraries are relocated and
audited to reject non-system absolute links and symlinks escaping the app. In settings choose Xcode and a player-provided directory containing shared `.bfttf` fonts. Recheck, choose an empty game library, import
`prod.keys`, then add NSP/XCI files or a folder. Metadata comes from decrypted, integrity-checked
CNMT/NACP; filenames are not used to classify base/update/DLC. New complete games
can enter the serial preparation queue automatically. Launching is always explicit.

The newest imported base/update and newest revision of each DLC are selected. An
update can be imported before its base; the library displays what is missing.
AArch32 is unsupported. Other titles are marked experimental: prepared products
are not a claim that a particular game or scene is compatible. Data DLC that
cannot be decrypted stops preparation instead of silently becoming license-only.
The shared font directory and generated timezone data are recorded as preparation
inputs; this does not implement a general firmware-container importer.

The Mac game shell is enabled only by `S2A_MAC_FRONTEND=1`; default `make host`
retains its headless test behavior. It attaches a native `CAMetalLayer`, feeds the
existing `s2a_vpad_read` HID ABI, resets input on loss of focus, and closes through
the host's graceful shutdown path. Automatic test-player input is disabled.
Use the details page to choose game language and edit keyboard/controller mappings.
Language is mapped to `S2A_SYSTEM_LANGUAGE`, mode to `S2A_DOCKED`.

游戏内存由编译过程自动配置，无需选择内存模式。编译只读游戏主程序的代码特征生成包内的
`addr_need.tsv`，不需要先运行游戏、不读运行日志；Mac 与 iOS 使用相同的需求表和布局算法。
旧版手动内存设置会在保存偏好时移除，其他设置保留。旧准备包需要重新编译。

Preparation binds the table to the program ID and main NSO build ID. The alias
field is a static hint read from the main NSO: a nonzero value means the program
claims a huge alias address region at start-up (a constant size passed to
`nn::os::AllocateAddressRegion`), so the host lays the alias region out first. The
ordinary heap field is always the application pool. No run logs or per-game tables
are consulted.

The normalized requirements and collector version participate in preparation and
rewrite cache keys. Engine and release manifests declare `memoryRequirementsVersion`
so an old host cannot silently ignore the new heap field. Shader reuse follows its
existing cache rules. The retired `vammLayout` request is rejected; no environment
switch, per-game memory preference, or game-specific layout rule is required.

With the mouse set to camera mode, click inside the game view to capture relative
motion and hide the cursor. The capture click does not send an attack. Press Esc
or switch windows to release it; click again to recapture. In mouse-button-only
mode, the cursor stays free. While captured, Esc only releases the mouse and does
not send its mapped game button. Press Esc again after release to use that binding.
Camera motion feeds the Switch right stick and still
follows the game's turn-speed limit; it is not a native PC mouse-look interface.

## Mac controls guide / Mac 键位引导

Human launches show a per-game controls card before spawning the host when enabled.
The AI/control-port `/launch` path treats the guide as already handled and starts
directly, without waiting for a human confirmation. The selected game metadata supplies its name/ID; game-specific mappings take
priority over the global default. Confirming the card passes that exact mapping to
the Mac job, which validates it and writes a unique `runtime-input/<gameId>/<taskId>.json`
snapshot. The native HID adapter and in-game guide use the same dictionary loaded
once at host startup. Editing a saved mapping never relabels an already-running game.
The launch job rejects a runtime manifest belonging to a different game. It removes
its own snapshot after the host exits, including error and cancellation paths,
without deleting another run's file.

The mapping editor and pre-launch card share an interactive paired Joy-Con diagram,
with classic Neon Blue on the left and Neon Red on the right. Select a physical
button to inspect / edit its keyboard, mouse and controller inputs. Full-list,
stick/mouse options and the existing live input-test page remain available.
Input recording and testing stay scoped to this window. The controls pages use a
uniform white light-theme background (black in dark mode), neutral separators and
blue focus indicators with charcoal actions; they do not change the rest of the launcher's theme.
The editor uses left-aligned, full-width input menus and a single evenly spaced
keyboard-shortcut row. Its per-button restore action stays directly below the
binding fields rather than floating at the bottom of the panel. Menu hit areas
include the complete outlined surface, not only the text.
Expanded options share a white/black popover with checkmarks, keyboard focus,
scrolling for longer lists, and selection/escape dismissal. The full binding list,
mouse/stick options use the same controls and panel spacing;
there are no separate grey system-picker or grouped-form surfaces on these pages.
The original vector outlines preserve Nintendo's published **102 × 35.9 mm**
height/width ratio; circular controls are not stretched. Button/stick anchors are
illustrative front-view positions calibrated to Nintendo support imagery, not CAD
measurements. HOME / Capture are decorative only and do not add unsupported ABI inputs.

Nintendo photographs are references only and are not bundled in this change.

Review screenshots and execution evidence are attached to the pull request, not
stored in the source tree. UI evidence uses synthetic fixtures without game
resources, keys, saves or real device identifiers.

The guide is built into the Mac host via `S2A_MAC_FRONTEND=1` and the existing
engine packaging closure (`macos/`). No companion installation,
Python UI, private game profile or copied local helper is required. Newly built
engine bundles and newly prepared Mac game hosts include it automatically. Old
prebuilt hosts must be rebuilt; merely updating launcher sources cannot retrofit
a previously compiled executable. This does not change Android, iOS or HarmonyOS
shells/builds, and does not imply game compatibility or playability.

In game, use the menu-bar controller icon or **Controls / 查看键位 (⌘K)**. Closing
the guide returns focus to the game rather than shutting down the host. Viewing
controls does **not** pause guest execution. The native guide uses a matching
red/blue paired Joy-Con diagram: selecting any of its 24 supported targets only
changes the read-only detail panel. It never edits or saves the loaded mapping.
Stick selections also show the frozen analogue-axis sources. The menu-bar entry
uses an original, monochrome paired Joy-Con template icon that adapts to the
system appearance. The launcher keeps mapping configuration on the game detail
page and in settings, without a duplicate keyboard toolbar shortcut.

The pre-launch “show next launch” toggle publishes its file-backed preference
change immediately, so both checking and unchecking visibly reflect the saved
value. This preference remains in the launcher, not the read-only native guide.
Mouse buttons emulate controller
buttons; this is not native point-and-click menu support. Actions depend on the
game: the common guide does not invent title-specific skill/menu meanings.

The launcher's “show next launch” control and the native guide share
`<privateRoot>/input-guides/<gameId>.json` (schema 1, `gameId`, boolean `show`).
The job passes its location as `S2A_INPUT_GUIDE_PREFS`; other IDs cannot inherit
that record. `S2A_GAME_NAME`/`S2A_GAME_ID` come from catalogue metadata, while
`gameName`/`gameId` in the prepared manifest provide native fallback metadata.
The native guide never opens automatically, including CLI hosts: it is available
only through the menu or Command-K. The pre-launch preference invalidates the
visible launcher view immediately after a successful write. Native controls are Chinese/English according to
`S2A_UI_LANGUAGE` (or system language). Old hosts without confirmed input support
get an explicit warning instead of presenting saved mappings as active controls.

Tests use synthetic mappings and no game resources: `InputGuideTests` covers the
pre-launch handoff, stale-sheet rejection, per-game preferences, optional mapping
fields and bilingual rendering; `pack/jobs/tests/test_jobs.py` covers validation,
per-run snapshot isolation and wrong-game rejection; `Tests/input_test.m` exercises
the actual Mac adapter, native guide data, shared preferences and identity fallback.
For a no-game interactive native preview, run its built test binary with
`--guide-preview`, optionally setting `S2A_GAME_NAME`, `S2A_GAME_ID` and
`S2A_UI_LANGUAGE`. A preview window is not a real game acceptance result.

## Data and isolation

- Launcher identity: `org.s2arm.macos.launcher`; private settings/jobs/keys/tools:
  `~/Library/Application Support/S2Arm`. `--data-root <directory>` isolates testing.
  Existing LumaDock/NSMac settings and libraries are not automatically migrated.
- Each library has `.s2arm-library.json` with a UUID. A missing external disk or
  mismatched UUID fails closed; the worker does not create a substitute library.
- `sources/`: managed content-addressed original containers. Imports clone/copy and
  SHA-256 verify them. The original files are never modified.
- `cache/<titleId>/<identity>/`: private build roots/checkpoints. Input content,
  source content, target, tool versions and fonts determine the build identity.
- `games/<titleId>/releases/` and atomic `current`: independent complete products;
  cancellation/failure preserves the preceding successful version. Each release
  includes a file hash/size manifest checked before launch.
- `saves/<titleId>/`: persistent Ryujinx data including the player's saves.
  `S2A_SAVE_DIR` is intentionally not used: it is a seed/import interface that clears
  and replaces saves at boot. Runtime shader caches live in `runtime-cache/`.
- Game details → **存档备份与恢复… / Save backup and restoration** exports a
  verified `.s2asave` archive and previews compatibility before restoring. Stop the
  game first. Restoration retains the original data and a pre-restore archive under
  `save-backups/<titleId>/`; interrupted transactions recover before the next launch.
  The [G05 v1 format and recovery contract](../../docs/存档备份_G05.md) is the
  handoff for future platform migration; actual game readback remains to be verified.
- Remove only hides the catalogue entry. Source/cache cleanup are separate,
  confirmed actions and never delete runtime releases or saves. Shared source files
  used by another catalogue entry are retained.

Jobs use their own cache/lock/output roots and never call the scheduler, train,
device deployment, shared root refresh or a game-specific SDK hook. Engine resources
are verified and cloned from the signed app to `hosts/engine/<bundle-content-id>/` in
the default library location (only the copy in use and the previous one are kept; before a library exists the
copy goes to `engines/` in private application storage). The signed application and runtime stay immutable; the
precompiled preparation helpers run from that engine copy. The original source-checkout pipeline
retains its default build behavior unless `S2A_PREBUILT_TOOLS` is explicitly set. The bundled preparation
source closure contains a fresh local-only Git snapshot for the existing pipeline
HEAD-based keys, without remotes, developer history or player data. Git maintenance
is disabled and initial compaction finishes before resource hashing and signing.
The source checkout is needed only to build the application or run CLI development
checks. A source change during packaging fails the build. `S2A_DEVELOPER_DIR` and `S2A_PYTHON` are explicit per-job overrides;
the repository's default toolchain and interpreter choices remain unchanged.

## Local job protocol

Run `python3 -I -B pack/jobs/main.py --request <0600-json-file>`. Requests include
`schema:1`, `jobId` (or the launcher's `taskId` alias), `operation`, `privateRoot`,
`engineDir` (CLI development), optional `engineBundle` (packaged app), `library`, `libraryId`, `developerDir`, and operation parameters.
Operations: `setup`, `preflight`, `prepareEngine`, `keys`, `import`, `catalog`,
`build`, `launch`, `remove`, `clean`, `saveInput`, `diagnostics`, `saveStatus`,
`saveBackup`, `saveInspect`, `saveRestore`.

Stdout is NDJSON with `schema`, `jobId`, monotonic `seq`, UTC `timestamp`, `stage`,
`state`, `doneUnits/totalUnits/unit`, result/artifact and error/log references.
Unknown totals are null; phase counts are not measured percentages. Heartbeats
keep silent compilers visible. Terminal protocol success is `succeeded`; the UI
normalizes it to its persisted `completed` state. Extra `type`, `taskId`, `done`
and `total` fields preserve the migrated UI's event adapter. This is a concrete Mac
adapter, not a claim that all planned Android deployment/resume APIs are implemented.

SIGTERM cancels only the job's subprocess groups through `tools/safe_killpg.sh`.
Requests are removed by the launcher; diagnostic exports contain bounded redacted
text/job records, never keys, source containers, resources or saves. Interrupted
UI jobs remain visible for explicit retry; validated extraction checkpoints can be
reused. Neither frontend tasks nor diagnostics alter the game's runtime log contract.

## Verification

### 空间预算与估时依据（G03）

编译任务保留 `space` 事件中的源文件大小、各写入卷的 `needBytes` /
`freeBytes`、预算依据和未量化开销；失败、结束及重新打开后的任务仍可查看。
这些字节值来自 `pack/jobs/library.py`，界面不合计不同卷，也不把未量化缓存
算作零；「达到预检门槛」只代表当时的检查结果。未知或无效读数显示未知，
不足以红色图标和文字同时提示。

里程碑消费可选的 `source` / `samples` / `basis`：当前阶段显示历史记录数或
默认参考值，任务卡可展开逐步依据。旧任务没有这些字段时仍可读取，来源标为
未知。前端不改变预算算法、阻断条件、估时历史格式或游戏/设备构建参数。
以上为主机预检展示，手机空间、传输与安装耗时仍需真机验收。

```sh
python3 -B -m unittest discover -s pack/jobs/tests -v
DEVELOPER_DIR=<Xcode.app/Contents/Developer> swift test --disable-sandbox \
  --cache-path "$PWD/build/macos/spm-cache" --package-path launchers/macos \
  --scratch-path build/macos/spm
bash launchers/macos/test.sh
```

`python3 launchers/macos/smoke_runtime.py --runtime <Resources/Runtime>
--tools <Resources/Engine/Binaries/Prepare>` exercises the actual bundled Python,
.NET without any SDK, RomFS index, SPIR-V/GAL translation, and the external Xcode
Metal compilation/link and GPU archive. Its
minimal shader/filesystem probes do not claim game compatibility.

The PR validation record distinguishes source/unit checks, actual app UI checks,
native host builds, and any real-game evidence. No game, key, save, cover or player
cache is committed as a test asset.
